# Programming-exercise-2

## Instructions

### Part 1: Create a Hero
Open `main.py`. You need to create variables to store the following information about a game character:
1.  **Name** (String): Give your hero a name (e.g., `"Aragon"`).
2.  **Level** (Integer): Set their starting level (e.g., `1`).
3.  **Money** (Double/Float): Give them some gold coins (e.g., `12.50`).
4.  **Class Initial** (Char): A single letter representing their job (e.g., `'W'` for Wizard, `'K'` for Knight).
5.  **Is Alive?** (Boolean): Set this to `True`.

### Part 2: Display the Stats
Use the `print()` command to display the stats on the screen. It should look like this:
```text
--- HERO STATS ---
Name: Aragon
Level: 1
Gold: 12.5
Class: W
Alive: True
```
Run your code in Thonny to make sure it prints the stats.

Upload your main.py file to this repository.
